Hi, I’m Casey! I’m transitioning into cybersecurity after completing a 6-month cybersecurity bootcamp and recently obtained the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification. I’ve gained hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Nessus, and I’m currently sharpening my skills through real-world projects like SIEM log analysis and cloud security.

I’m excited to continue learning and growing in this field, with the goal of eventually transitioning into cloud engineering. I’d love to connect and learn from others in the industry!

## Objective
My ultimate goal is to gain experience in cybersecurity and eventually transition into cloud engineering as I continue developing my expertise.
